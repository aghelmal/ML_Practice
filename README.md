# ML_Practice:
Welcome to my Machine Learning Playground!

This GitHub project is all about putting my Python skills and Machine Learning fundamentals to the test. I've organized it into two main folders: Supervised_ML and Unsupervised_ML. Inside each folder, you'll find example projects and my solutions to various exercises. These exercises are based on real projects from Kaggle, providing an excellent opportunity to dive deep into the world of Machine Learning.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to learn and improve, so your input is highly appreciated.

Let's learn and grow together in the fascinating realm of Machine Learning!

Happy coding,
