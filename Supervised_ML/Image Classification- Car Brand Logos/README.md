### Image Classification : Car-Brand-Logos
I use here a deep neural network and a CNN architecture for an image classification task.

Data set has been originally harvested from search engines and I downloaded it from Kaggle Website:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volkandl/car-brand-logos?resource=download
Data set contains 8 logo brands including; toyota, hyundai, lexus, skoda, volkswagen, mazda, mercedes, opel. It's divided as train and test images. In training set, there are over 300 images per logo. In test set, there are 63 photos for each.
